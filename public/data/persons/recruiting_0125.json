While his current role is confirmed via the MYM corporate site and LinkedIn, his previous experience at Decathlon Digital and SNCF (specifically on the TGVmax consumer product) is consistent with professional profiles for this individual, although some search snippets were missing the full history. MYM itself is a high-growth scale-up, and his previous employers (SNCF, Decathlon) are large-scale enterprises rather than Series A startups, though they meet the 'Series A+' (later stage/large) criteria.", "dimensions": {"relevance": {"score": 0.9, "reasoning": "He perfectly matches the role (PM), location (Paris), and domain (consumer mobile/social). His background includes large-scale consumer products (TGVmax) and a high-growth scale-up (MYM), satisfying the 'Series A+' requirement."}, "accuracy": {"score": 1.0, "reasoning": "All key details—name, current title, company, location, and specific squad focus—were verified through the company's official 'About' page and LinkedIn."}, "information_completeness": {"score": 0.9, "reasoning": "The profile provides name, title, company, location, bio, and previous companies; only direct contact info (email/phone) is missing, which is standard for public profiles."}, "uniqueness": {"score": 0.7, "reasoning": "While he is on LinkedIn, he is a specific 'squad lead' in a niche but significant French tech company, making him a high-value discovery for a recruiter compared to a generic top-tier executive."}}}]}
