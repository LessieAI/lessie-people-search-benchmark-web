The profile data provided in the prompt incorrectly mapped the company 'Together' to 'Together AI' (as seen in the job_company_linkedin_url and website fields in the raw data).", "dimensions": {"relevance": {"score": 0.0, "reasoning": "The person works for a different company called 'Together' (a productivity app) rather than the requested 'Together AI' (an AI infrastructure company)."}, "accuracy": {"score": 0.4, "reasoning": "While the person's name, title, and location are correct, the primary company identification is factually incorrect relative to the query's intent, likely due to a name collision."}, "information_completeness": {"score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The profile provides a full name, title, company (albeit the wrong one), location, bio, and LinkedIn URL."}, "uniqueness": {"score": 0.7, "reasoning": "The result is a non-obvious match that likely appeared due to a specific keyword overlap, though it is ultimately incorrect."}}}]}
